# Noteherder

## Homework

* Add google auth

### Bonus Credit

* If you're signed in, it briefly shows the SignIn component before Main. Fix that
    (store uid in local storage and loading that in component did mount)

* Scope notes by user. let each user have their own array of notes (try changing endpoint arg to base.syncState)
